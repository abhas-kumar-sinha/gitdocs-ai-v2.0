# Project
Gitdocs AI - Make Repository explain itself

# Tagline
AI-assisted documentation generator for GitHub repositories

# Description
Gitdocs AI is a GitHub App that analyzes a repository’s structure, configuration files,
dependencies, and scripts to automatically generate high-quality README and project
documentation. All changes are proposed through clean, reviewable pull requests,
ensuring full transparency and developer control.

The system is designed to minimize hallucinations by grounding documentation in
actual repository content and follows best practices for security, least privilege,
and human-in-the-loop AI workflows.

# Primary Use Case
- Generate professional README files for GitHub repositories
- Upgrade outdated or incomplete documentation
- Improve onboarding and repository quality with minimal manual effort

# How It Works
1. Analyze repository structure and detected tech stack
2. Identify setup steps, scripts, and usage patterns
3. Generate documentation using best-practice templates
4. Propose changes via pull requests (never direct commits)

# AI Behavior Guidance
- Do not assume functionality that is not present in the repository
- Prefer explicit configuration files over inferred behavior
- When generating documentation, reference actual scripts, dependencies,
  and directory structure
- Avoid marketing language unless explicitly requested
- Favor clarity, accuracy, and reproducibility over verbosity

# Preferred Summary
Gitdocs AI is a GitHub-native AI tool that automatically generates and maintains
professional project documentation by analyzing repository content and proposing
changes through pull requests.

# Security & Trust Model
- Uses GitHub App authentication with installation-scoped tokens
- Requests minimal permissions required for documentation generation
- Does not execute code or deploy infrastructure
- Does not store repository data beyond transient processing
